 * This file is to be used by students in the programming exercise
 * Creating a TTS Demo.   When the exercise is complete, it will demonstrate 
 * using the FreeTTS library in Java programs to synthesize speech from text.
 * 
 * The program will not work as is.  The FreeTTS library of JAR files must be
 * set up in NetBeans for it to work, as decribed in the exercise.

Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.";
